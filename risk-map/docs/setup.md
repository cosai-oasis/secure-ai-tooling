# Setup & Prerequisites

Before contributing to the Risk Map, ensure you have the necessary validation tools set up. You can set up your development environment either using the VS Code Dev Container (recommended) or through manual installation.

## Option 1: Using Dev Container (Recommended)

The repository includes a VS Code Dev Container configuration that provides a pre-configured development environment with all necessary dependencies.

**Prerequisites:**

- VS Code with the "Dev Containers" extension installed
- Docker Desktop or compatible container runtime
- Approximately 6GB of available disk space for the container image

**Setup:**

1. **Open the repository in VS Code**
2. **Reopen in Container**: When prompted (or use Command Palette: "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container")
3. **Wait for container build**: The first build installs Python 3.11, Node.js, Chrome/Chromium, and all project dependencies
4. **Install pre-commit hooks** (one-time setup):

   ```bash
   # From the repository root inside the container
   bash ./scripts/install-precommit-hook.sh
   ```

The Dev Container automatically provides:

- Python 3.11 with all requirements.txt dependencies
- Node.js 18+ with npm packages (prettier, mermaid-cli)
- Chrome/Chromium browser pre-installed for SVG generation
- act tool for local GitHub Actions testing
- VS Code extensions: Mermaid preview, YAML validation, Ruff linting

## Option 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer not to use the Dev Container or need to set up your environment manually:

**Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Chrome/Chromium browser (for SVG generation from Mermaid diagrams)

1. **Install dependencies and pre-commit hook (one-time setup)**:

   ```bash
   # From the repository root
   # Install required Python packages
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Install Node.js dependencies (prettier, mermaid-cli, etc.)
   npm install

   # Install the pre-commit hook
   bash ./scripts/install-precommit-hook.sh
   ```

2. **Verify the hook is working**:
   ```bash
   # Make a test change to risk-map/yaml/components.yaml
   # Attempt to commit - the hook should run validation
   git add risk-map/yaml/components.yaml
   git commit -m "test commit"
   ```

## Platform Considerations for SVG Generation

The repository handles Mermaid diagrams with different approaches for local development versus GitHub Actions:

### Pre-commit Hooks (Local Development)

- **Automatic SVG Creation**: When Mermaid files (`.mmd`, `.mermaid`) are staged for commit, pre-commit hooks generate corresponding SVG files
- **Auto-staging**: Generated SVG files are automatically added to the commit
- **Location**: SVGs are created in `./risk-map/svg/` directory
- **Prerequisites**: Requires Chrome/Chromium browser and mermaid-cli (automatically handled in Dev Container)

### Platform-Specific Setup

**Note**: If using the Dev Container, Chrome/Chromium is pre-installed. For manual setup:

- **Mac/Windows/Linux x64**: Chrome automatically handled by puppeteer
- **Linux ARM64**: Requires manual Chromium setup:

  ```bash
  # Use the --install-playwright flag during setup
  ./scripts/install-precommit-hook.sh --install-playwright

  # Or install manually
  npx playwright install chromium --with-deps
  ```
