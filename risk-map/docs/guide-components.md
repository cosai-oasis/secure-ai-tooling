# Adding a Component

Once you've determined the need for a new component, the following steps are required to integrate it into the framework. For this example, we'll add a new component called `componentNewComponent` to the "Application" category.

## 1. Add the new component ID to the schema

First, declare the new component's unique ID in the schema. This makes the system aware of the new component and allows for validation.

- **File to edit**: `schemas/components.schema.json`
- **Action**: Find the `enum` list under `definitions.component.properties.id` and add your new component's ID. The ID should follow the `component[Name]` convention.

```json
// In schemas/components.schema.json
"id": {
  "type": "string",
  "enum": [
    ...
    "componentAgentPlugin",
    "componentNewComponent" // Add your new component ID here
  ]
},
```

## 2. Add the new component definition to the YAML file

Next, define the properties of your new component in the main data file. This includes its ID, title, a detailed description, and its category.

- **File to edit**: `components.yaml`
- **Action**: Add a new entry to the `components` list.

```yaml
# In yaml/components.yaml
- id: componentNewComponent
  title: New Component
  description:
    - >
      A detailed description of what this new component represents in the
      AI development lifecycle and why it is important for understanding risk.
  category: componentsApplication # Must match an id from the components.schema.json#/definitions/category/properties/id
  edges:
    to: []
    from: []
```

## 3. Define Edges for the New Component

Now, define the connections for your new component within its own `edges` block. The `to` list specifies where your component sends data (outgoing), and the `from` list specifies where it receives data from (incoming).

⚠️ **Critical**: Component edges must be **bidirectionally consistent**. The pre-commit hook will enforce this rule.

- **File to edit**: `components.yaml`
- **Action**: Update the `edges` block for `componentNewComponent`. For our example, let's say it receives data from `componentInputHandling` and sends data to `componentApplication`.

```yaml
# In yaml/components.yaml, under your new component's definition
edges:
  to:
    - componentApplication # Outgoing connection
  from:
    - componentInputHandling # Incoming connection
```

## 4. Update Edges on Connected Components

To make the connections bidirectional, you must now update the corresponding `edges` on the components you just referenced. **This step is critical** - the pre-commit hook will prevent commits if edges are not bidirectionally consistent.

- **File to edit**: `components.yaml`
- **Action**:
  1.  Find the `componentInputHandling` definition and add `componentNewComponent` to its `edges.to` list.
  2.  Find the `componentApplication` definition and add `componentNewComponent` to its `edges.from` list.

```yaml
# In the componentInputHandling definition:
- id: componentInputHandling
  # other properties
  edges:
    to:
      - componentTheModel
      - componentNewComponent # Add outgoing edge to your new component
    from:
      - componentApplication

# In the componentApplication definition:
- id: componentApplication
  # other properties
  edges:
    to:
      - componentInputHandling
      - componentAgentPlugin
    from:
      - componentOutputHandling
      - componentNewComponent # Add incoming edge from your new component
```

## 5. Validate Changes & Generate Graph

Before committing, validate that your changes are consistent:

```bash
# Manual validation (recommended during development)
python scripts/hooks/validate_riskmap.py --force

# Optional: Generate component graph to visualize your changes
python scripts/hooks/validate_riskmap.py --to-graph ./preview-graph.md --force

# Optional: Generate control-to-component graph to visualize control relationships
python scripts/hooks/validate_riskmap.py --to-controls-graph ./preview-controls.md --force

# Optional: Generate controls-to-risk graph to visualize risk relationships
python scripts/hooks/validate_riskmap.py --to-risk-graph ./preview-risks.md --force

# Format YAML files (auto-runs in pre-commit but useful for preview)
npx prettier --write risk-map/yaml/components.yaml

# The pre-commit hook will also run all validations automatically when you commit
git add risk-map/yaml/components.yaml
git commit -m "Add componentNewComponent with proper edge relationships"
```

The validation will check:

- ✅ All outgoing edges (`to`) have corresponding incoming edges (`from`) in target components
- ✅ All incoming edges (`from`) have corresponding outgoing edges (`to`) in source components
- ✅ No components are isolated (unless intentionally designed)
- ✅ All referenced components exist in the YAML file

**Note**: When you commit changes to `components.yaml`, the pre-commit hook automatically generates:

- Updated component graph at `./risk-map/diagrams/risk-map-graph.md`
- Component tables at `./risk-map/tables/components-full.md` and `components-summary.md`
- Regenerated cross-reference at `./risk-map/tables/controls-xref-components.md`

All files are automatically staged for your commit.

## 6. Create a Pull Request

After successful validation, follow the [General Content Contribution Workflow](workflow.md) to create your pull request.
