    Categorizes the types of security, privacy, and safety impacts that risks pose and
    controls address. Includes traditional security concerns (confidentiality, integrity,
    availability, privacy, compliance) and AI-specific impacts (safety, fairness,
    accountability, reliability, transparency). These categories help assess the scope
    and nature of AI system risks
