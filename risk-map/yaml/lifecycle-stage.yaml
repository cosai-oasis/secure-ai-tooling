    Defines the phases of AI system development, deployment, and operation. This eight-stage
    lifecycle covers the complete journey from initial planning through data preparation,
    model training, development, evaluation, deployment, runtime operation, and ongoing
    maintenance. Each stage presents unique security considerations and risk profiles
